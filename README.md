# Personal Formulae

These are formulae that I use to have everything into homebrew instead of scattered through package managers only to get a binary.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install vheon/homebrew/<formula>`

Or `brew tap vheon/homebrew` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
